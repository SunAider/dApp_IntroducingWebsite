          <p>1. Decentralized prediction markets are said to be a field that will continue to grow in the crypto world.
            <em style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">EMA</em> will connect and integrate its own Ul to the
            cutting-edge Web 3.0 technology, the Azuro protocol. The
            protocol can predict the results of professional sports matches held around the world and predetermine
            excellent market
            prices.
            Therefore, connected and integrated apps will be able to provide even better functionality with their own
            UI. In the expanding field of prediction markets, <em
              style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">EMA</em>'s growth is promising as it enters the growing
            field of decentralized bookmakers.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>2. Decentralized bookmakers operated only using smart contracts and blockchain are particularly sound and
            transparent, and users who prefer them will surely increase. As you can imagine from the domain name ninja,
            the app [bookmaker.ninja] developed by <em style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">EMA</em> is also
            conscious of the rapidly expanding Japanese market. <em
              style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">EMA</em>'s profitability and
            development capabilities are high as it introduces cutting-edge decentralized technology related to
            gambling. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> 3. <em style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">EMA</em> has a very advantageous characteristic as a
            virtual currency, that is, it can generate profits
            through decentralized bookmaking, so we believe that there is a possibility that the price will rise
            significantly
            in the future.</p>
