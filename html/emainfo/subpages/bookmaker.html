      What is bookmaker.NINJA? An on-chain sports betting platform.

      bookmaker.NINJA's core mission is to enable users to bet in a safe and trustless way, without KYC requirements and
      without relying on a central authority. Your funds are your funds. Always. While traditional bookmakers (bet365,
      WilliamHill, Draftkings, Stake, etc.) require you to deposit funds to bet, https://bookmaker.ninja testnet
      https://bookmaker-test.ninja/ No deposit is required at all. When you place a bet, your money goes directly from
      your wallet to a smart contract on the blockchain where the outcome is pre-determined. Once the game/event is over, the
      contract allows you to claim your winnings (if you won).


      Why bookmaker.NINJA?
      1.NINJA betting is different
      bookmaker.NINJA cannot seize your money or decide if and when you receive your winnings. bookmaker.NINJA has no
      access to it. There are no deposits or withdrawals, and no balances are left on bookmaker.NINJA. Everything is
      decided programmatically, completely on-chain, by smart contracts. Your money -your bets. Always.

      2. NINJA bets are anonymous
      There is no need to create an account, log in, or send documents for verification. All you need is cryptocurrency
      and a Web3 wallet like Metamask. If you are new to cryptocurrency, the technical part may seem difficult, but once
      you understand it, it is very easy.

      3. J betting is rewarding
      NINJA will be running promotions every week. There are plenty of chances to win free bets and NFTs (and more).

      4. Betting is fun
      But be sure to stop when it stops being fun.

      P S. In this way, bookmaker.ninja is destroying the concept of gambling from the ground upvaluing soundness,
      transparency, and usability, and aiming to be a bookmaker that everyone who uses it can truly enjoy. Please look
      forward to NINJA, which will be released by EM AD ATA SOOR.</p>
